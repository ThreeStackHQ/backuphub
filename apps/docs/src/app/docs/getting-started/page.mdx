# Getting Started

Welcome to BackupHub — the automated database backup platform by ThreeStack. This guide walks you through creating your account, adding your first database, and running your first backup.

## Create Your Account

1. Visit [backuphub.threestack.io](https://backuphub.threestack.io) and click **Sign Up**
2. Enter your email address and choose a secure password
3. You'll be redirected to the dashboard after signup

> BackupHub uses JWT-based authentication with 30-day session expiry. Your credentials are hashed with bcrypt and never stored in plain text.

## Dashboard Overview

After signing in, you'll land on the **Dashboard** — your central hub for managing backups.

The dashboard provides:

- **Database count** — Total connected databases
- **Backup count** — Total backups stored
- **Latest backup** — Timestamp of your most recent backup
- **Storage used** — Total backup storage consumed

### Navigation

Use the sidebar to navigate between sections:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Dashboard** | Overview and quick stats |
| **Databases** | Manage database connections |
| **Backups** | View backup history and restore |
| **Schema Diff** | Compare database schemas |
| **Settings** | Account and workspace settings |

## Add Your First Database

1. Navigate to **Databases** in the sidebar
2. Click **Add Database**
3. Fill in the connection details:
   - **Name** — A friendly label (e.g., "Production PostgreSQL")
   - **Type** — PostgreSQL or MySQL
   - **Host** — Your database hostname
   - **Port** — Default: `5432` (PostgreSQL) or `3306` (MySQL)
   - **Database** — The database name
   - **Username** and **Password** — Credentials with read access
4. Click **Test Connection** to verify connectivity
5. Click **Save** to add the database

> All database credentials are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage. See [Connection Setup](/docs/connection-setup) for detailed configuration.

## Run Your First Backup

Once a database is connected:

1. Go to **Backups**
2. Click **Create Backup**
3. Select the database you want to back up
4. Click **Start Backup**

The backup runs in the background using `pg_dump` or `mysqldump`. You'll see the backup appear in your timeline once complete.

Backups are compressed with gzip and stored in Cloudflare R2 object storage.
